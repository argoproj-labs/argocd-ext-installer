# Argo CD Extension Installer

This repo provides a docker image that can be used as an init
container to install Argo CD extensions.

# How to use this image

This image should be added in the Argo CD API server as an init
container. Once the API server starts the init container will download
and install the configured UI extension. All configuration is provided
as environment variables as part of the init container. Find below the
list of all environment variables that can be configured:
